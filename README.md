currently all regular sentences should work (including sentences with 'ށ').
( i will update this after writing the tests )

Known Issue: in thaana writing akuru without a fili can be used in multiple scenarios.
Case 1 - Should be read as the name of the akuru (so for 'ށ' it would be "shaviyani"). example for this is when writing prefixes like atoll names, house names, etc.
Case 2 - Should be read as the sound of the akuru (so for 'ށ' it would be "sh"). this is less relevant for most characters but for 'ށ' it is relevant as when it appears in the middle of a word it should be 'n'.

Case 1 - should be implemented
Case 2 - should be implemented for 'ށ' but for other characters it is technically incorrect grammar so maybe they should follow Case 1 always.

NOTE: i have not added mapping yet. but in theory everything should work.
